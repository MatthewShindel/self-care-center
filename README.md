# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

The webpage is a self-care center, a web application that generates affiramtions or mantras for the user to see. The goal of this product is to help develop a user feeling of self-worth.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

Simply open up the webpage in your browser to see a simple form for you the interact with. By selecting either affirmations or mantras, the user can easily generate a new mantra for themselves by clicking the Create Message button. Each time a user does this, a new message is created. By clicking the Clear message button at the bottom of teh webpage, they can start over from the beginning. Error handling is already built into the webpage.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

I worked on this for a about 4 hours over the course of a week. I'm currenty entering week 4 of my project.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
This is a solo project, so i work by myself for this assignment.
### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
I wanted to develop a better understanding of DOM and how to manipulate a webpage based on a users input. I used JS, HTML and CSS, almost all of which was written by myself.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

Radio buttons were new to me going into this project, so getting those to work and understanding how they functioned was very interesting for me. Additionally, getting the spacing of radio buttons to fit properly in the webpage was challenging, but I came up with what I think is a clever solution.
